## 🎤 Viva Questions & Answers

### Basic Level Questions

**Q1: What is Streamlit and why did you choose it?**
**A:** Streamlit is an open-source Python framework for creating web applications. I chose it because:
- Easy to learn and implement
- Requires minimal code for UI components
- Built-in support for data visualization
- Fast prototyping capabilities
- No HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge needed

**Q2: How does your dashboard handle missing values?**
**A:** The dashboard uses multiple strategies:
- `dropna()` for critical columns like Age_Group and Screen_Time_Hours
- `fillna()` with default values for non-critical columns
- Data validation to remove invalid entries (e.g., negative hours, >24 hours)

**Q3: Explain the difference between bar chart and histogram in your dashboard.**
**A:** 
- **Bar Chart**: Shows categorical data (e.g., average by age group). Each bar represents a category.
- **Histogram**: Shows frequency distribution of continuous data (screen time hours). Bars represent ranges/bins.

**Q4: What is the purpose of the @st.cache_data decorator?**
**A:** It caches the data loading function to improve performance. Data is loaded once and reused until the file changes, making the dashboard faster.

**Q5: How do filters work in your dashboard?**
**A:** Filters use Streamlit's selectbox widgets. When a user selects a value, the DataFrame is filtered using pandas conditional statements, and all visualizations automatically update with the filtered data.

---

### Intermediate Level Questions

**Q6: Explain the color scheme choices in your visualizations.**
**A:** 
- Used contrasting colors for different categories (gender, location)
- Color gradients for continuous values (intensity representation)
- ColorBlind-friendly palettes (Plotly's Set3, Viridis)
- Blue theme for professional appearance

**Q7: What is a pivot table and where did you use it?**
**A:** A pivot table reshapes data by grouping and aggregating. I used it in the heatmap to create a matrix of Age Group (rows) vs Device Type (columns) with average screen time as values.

**Q8: How would you handle very large datasets?**
**A:** 
- Use data sampling for visualization
- Implement pagination for data display
- Use more efficient data structures (e.g., categorical dtypes)
- Load data in chunks
- Optimize groupby operations with numba/cython

**Q9: What insights can you derive from the heatmap?**
**A:** 
- Device preferences by age group
- Transition patterns as children grow older
- Multiple dimension analysis (age + device simultaneously)
- Hotspots indicate high usage combinations

**Q10: How does your dashboard ensure data quality?**
**A:** 
- Input validation (screen time between 0-24 hours)
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values systematically
- Type conversion with error handling
- Data range validation

---

### Advanced Level Questions

**Q11: Explain the concept of reactive programming in Streamlit.**
**A:** Streamlit uses reactive programming where the entire script reruns when user input changes. This creates a data flow where:
- User interaction triggers rerun
- Cached functions skip recomputation
- UI updates automatically
- State management through session_state

**Q12: How would you deploy this dashboard for public access?**
**A:** Options include:
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Free hosting, direct GitHub integration
- **Heroku**: Cloud platform with free tier
- **AWS/Azure**: For enterprise deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization for any cloud platform

**Q13: What are the limitations of your current dashboard?**
**A:** 
- No user authentication
- Limited to single CSV file
- No database integration
- Basic statistical analysis only
- No export functionality for reports

**Q14: How would you add predictive analytics to this dashboard?**
**A:** Could implement:
- Time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Classification models to predict high-risk users
- Clustering to identify user segments
- Regression for screen time prediction
- Using scikit-learn or TensorFlow

**Q15: Explain the difference between Plotly and Matplotlib.**
**A:** 
- **Plotly**: Interactive, web-based, hover tooltips, zoom/pan, better for dashboards
- **Matplotlib**: Static, publication-quality, more customization, better for reports
- Plotly is used here for interactivity

**A:** 
- Statistical method: Remove values beyond 3 standard deviations
- Domain knowledge: Cap at realistic maximum (24 hours)
- Visual inspection: Box plots to identify outliers
- Separate analysis: Create "extreme usage" category

**Q17: How would you compare this year's data with previous year?**
**A:** 
- Load multiple datasets
- Add year column
- Create comparison visualizations (grouped bar charts)
- Calculate year-over-year growth rates
- Trend analysis with line charts

**Q18: How can this dashboard help school administrators?**
**A:** 
- Identify at-risk students (excessive usage)
- Plan digital wellness programs
- Resource allocation (devices needed)
- Policy making (screen time limits)
